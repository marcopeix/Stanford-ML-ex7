Implementing unsupervised learning techniques such as K-mean clustering and Principal component analysis (PCA)

K-mean clustering was used on a dataset to help visualize how the algorithm works. Then, it was used on an image to compress it and reduce the number of colors in the image.

PCA was also used on a dataset and on images. However, there were no clear outcomes from the assignment, which is a bit disappointing. It felt like just applying the algorithm without clear objectives.
